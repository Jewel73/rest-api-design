# E-Commerce API

## Overview

Welcome to the E-Commerce API project! This API follows best practices in API design, utilizing the OpenAPI specification, Flyway for database migrations, exceptional handling, and HATEOAS hypermedia links. This documentation will guide you through the setup, usage, and features of the API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)
- [Spring Boot 3.x](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
- [Your Database Server] (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-api.git
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cd e-commerce-api
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. Configure your database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### Authentication

Describe the authentication mechanism here (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

### Endpoints

List and briefly explain the available endpoints. Provide example requests and responses.

### Examples

Provide usage examples with code snippets.

## Database Migration
