# REST API Design - Gradle Project

## Overview

Welcome to the REST API Design project! This API follows best practices in API design, utilizing the OpenAPI specification, Flyway for database migrations, exceptional handling, and HATEOAS hypermedia links. This documentation will guide you through the setup, usage, and features of the API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
- [Your Database Server] (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jewel73/rest-api-design.git
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cd rest-api-design
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Configure your database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### Authentication

Describe the authentication mechanism here (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

### Endpoints

List and briefly explain the available endpoints. Provide example requests and responses.

### Examples

Provide usage examples with code snippets.

## Database Migration

Explain how to manage database migrations using Flyway.

```bash
./gradlew flywayMigrate
```

## Exception Handling

Explain how exceptions are handled in the API and how to interpret error responses.

## HATEOAS Hypermedia Links

Describe how hypermedia links are used to navigate the API.

## OpenAPI Specification

Link to the OpenAPI Specification document or describe where it can be found.
